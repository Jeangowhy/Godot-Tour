# Main Screen Plugin Demo

This plugin demo shows how to make a main screen plugin.
The main screen appears as a button next to the "2D", "3D", "Script", and
"AssetLib" buttons. It also shows up when a Node it `handles` is selected.

For more information, see this documentation article:
https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/plugins/editor/making_main_screen_plugins.html

If you would like to see a more complete example of what main screen plugins
are capable of, check out the [2.5D demo project](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/583).

# 2.5D Demo Project with GDScript

2.5D editor viewport for easily editing 2.5D levels.

Language: GDScript

Renderer: GLES 2

Note: There is a Mono C# version available [here](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/master/mono/2.5d).
